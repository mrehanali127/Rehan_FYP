# Literature Review Of React & React Native
## What is React?
A Javascript library for building user interfaces. It is created by Facebook. Heart of all react applications are components.
In React we are dealing with components. component is an independent piece of UI.
React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.
React uses Virtual DOM, thereby creating web applications faster.
React is a library, Not a Framework.
One important distinction between libraries like React and frameworks like Ember.js and 
AngularJS is that React is concerned only with rendering the UI and leaves many things up 
to each project to put together.

### History of React
React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook,
 who released an early prototype of React called "FaxJS".
He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component library for PHP. 
It was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and later on Instagram in 2012.
It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013.

## React Native
React Native is a popular JavaScript-based mobile app framework that allows you to build natively-rendered mobile apps for iOS and Android.
React Native was built based on React – a JavaScript library.
React Native lets you create truly native apps
 and doesn't compromise your users' experiences.
 
### History of React Native
React Native, which enables native Android, iOS, and UWP development with React, was announced at Facebook's React Conf in February 2015 and open-sourced in March 2015.

## Node.js
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment
 that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
 Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content.
 Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm.
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers
 that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write the server-side code in addition to the client-side code 
without the need to learn a completely different language.
Node.js came into existence when the original developers of JavaScript extended it
 from something you could only run in the browser to something you could run on
 your machine as a standalone application.
### History of Node.js
Node.js was developed by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and its latest version is v0.10.36.
